# Project1
This is one of my data science projects. The data I played with is from Kaggle. It is "Telco Customer Churn Dataset".
In this repository, I have uploaded raw data file and my python notebook (Data exploration.ipynb)
I mainly focused on exploring data - univariate, multivariate analysis and also cleaning data.
