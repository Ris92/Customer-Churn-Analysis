# Project1 - Customer Churn Analysis
This is one of my data science projects which I did in python. The data I played with is from Kaggle. It is "Telco Customer Churn Dataset".

In this repository, I have uploaded raw data file, preprocessed data file and my python notebooks. My data exploration file ((Data exploration.ipynb) is all about univariate, multivariate analysis, data cleaning and feature engineering. I have done some feature selection as well.

After I did exploration and cleaning data, the new clean data(PreprocessedData.csv) is ready for modeling. I tried different machine learning algorithms(Predictive Modeling.ipynb) on the data to understand the factors influencing churn as well as to predict. In addition, I did survival analysis.
